# Playwright vs Selenium: A Modern Comparison

As a QA automation expert with extensive experience in both Playwright and Selenium, I often get asked about which framework is better for test automation. In this article, I'll share my insights on both tools and help you make an informed decision for your next project.

## Why This Comparison Matters

The choice of automation framework can significantly impact your project's success. Both Playwright and Selenium are powerful tools, but they have different strengths and use cases.

## Key Differences

### 1. Architecture

Playwright uses a modern architecture that provides better control over browser automation:

- Built-in support for multiple browser engines
- Direct communication with browser protocols
- Better handling of modern web features

Selenium, being the older framework:

- Relies on WebDriver protocol
- Requires browser-specific drivers
- Has a more traditional client-server architecture

### 2. Performance

In my experience, Playwright shows superior performance in several areas:

- Faster test execution
- Better handling of dynamic content
- More reliable wait mechanisms
- Reduced flakiness in tests

### 3. Features

Playwright comes with modern features out of the box:

- Network interception
- Mobile emulation
- Multiple tabs and contexts
- Better shadow DOM support

## When to Choose Each Framework

### Choose Playwright When:

- You need modern web application testing
- Performance is a critical factor
- You want built-in mobile testing capabilities
- You need powerful network interception

### Choose Selenium When:

- You have legacy applications to test
- You need extensive community support
- You require specific language bindings
- Your team has existing Selenium expertise

## Code Comparison

Here's a simple example of how both frameworks handle clicking a button:

```javascript
// Playwright
await page.click('#submit-button');

// Selenium
driver.findElement(By.id('submit-button')).click();
```

## Conclusion

While both frameworks have their place, I find Playwright to be the more modern and efficient choice for new projects. Its superior performance, built-in features, and excellent documentation make it my go-to recommendation for most teams.
